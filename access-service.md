# GCALLS COMMUNITY - ACCESS SERVICE

***

Access service is a one of the main service of this project. This service is responsible for receiving requests from the above services such as webphone service, mobile service, ... and calling the below services such as user service, customer service, .. to perform the request, then return the results for the above services

### Technology

***

* Multi-tenancy:
    - is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers. Each customer is called a tenant. Tenants may be given the ability to customize some parts of the application, such as color of the user interface (UI) or business rules, but they cannot customize the application's code.
    - Multi-tenancy can be economical because software development and maintenance costs are shared. It can be contrasted with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to code. With a multi-tenancy architecture, the provider only has to make updates once. With a single-tenancy architecture, the provider has to touch multiple instances of the software in order to make updates.
    - In cloud computing, the meaning of multi-tenancy architecture has broadened because of new service models that take advantage of virtualization and remote access. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, for example, can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multiple customers. In such a scenario, each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
* Basic authentication:
    - In the context of a HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for a HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.
    - HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it doesn't require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header, obviating the need for handshakes.
* RESTful API:
    - An architectural style called [REST (Representational State Transfer)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) advocates that web applications should use HTTP as it was originally envisioned. Lookups should use __GET__ requests. __PUT__, __POST__, and __DELETE__ requests should be used for "mutation, creation, and deletion respectively".üë©
    - Building RESTful web services, like other programming skills is part art, part science. As the Internet industry progresses, creating a REST API becomes more concrete with emerging best practices. As RESTful web services don't follow a prescribed standard except for HTTP, it's important to build your RESTful API in accordance with industry best practices to ease development and increase client adoption.
* Domain Driven Design (DDD): is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model. The premise of domain-driven design is the following:
    - placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.
    - basing complex designs on a model of the domain.üåè
    - initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
* HTTP protocol:
    - HTTP means _HyperText Transfer Protocol_. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
    - HTTP is called a _stateless_ protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement Web sites that react intelligently to user input. This shortcoming of HTTP is being addressed in a number of new technologies, including ActiveX, Java, JavaScript and cookies.
    - A similar abbreviation, _HTTPS_ means _Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure_. Basically, it is the secure version of HTTP. Communications between the browser and website are encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS), or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).üéß

### Prerequisites

***

* Ubuntu:
    - is an open source operating system software for computers. It is one of the distribution systems of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), and is based on the [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) architecture. Besides personal computers, Ubuntu is available for tablets and smartphones, with the Ubuntu Touch edition. It also runs network servers. That is usually with the Ubuntu Server edition, either on physical or virtual servers (such as on mainframes) or with containers, that is with enterprise-class features. It runs on the most popular architectures, including server-class ARM-based.
    - Ubuntu is published by Canonical Ltd, who offer commercial support. It is based on free software and named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, 'human-ness'), which Canonical Ltd. suggests can be loosely translated as "humanity to others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are".
    - Ubuntu is the most popular operating system running in hosted environments, so‚Äìcalled "clouds", as it is the most popular server [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution).
* npm:
    - is the package manager for JavaScript and the world‚Äôs largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code ‚Äî and assemble them in powerful new ways.üóë
    - The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.
    - npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.
    - Use npm to install, share, and distribute code; manage dependencies in your projects; and share & receive feedback with others.
* NodeJS:
    - is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/) engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
* Mongo:
    - is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is free and open-source, published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.üáªüá≥
